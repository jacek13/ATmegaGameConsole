# ATmegaGameConsole
Repository contains my engineering degree project which theme was **`Portable pocket game`**. the device allows you to program simple games and applications. The device has the following **capabilities**:

1. Communication with the **[Waveshare LCD 2.4 inch 320x230 display module](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.4inch_LCD_Module)**. The display control with the ILI9341 driver was written by me based on the documentation, manufacturer's examples and the book "[Mikrokontrolery AVR i ARM. Sterowanie wy≈õwietlaczami LCD](https://helion.pl/ksiazki/mikrokontrolery-avr-i-arm-sterowanie-wyswietlaczami-lcd-tomasz-francuz,miklcd.htm#format/e)". Communication uses **USART in MSPI** Mode. The [ILI9341_FAST](https://github.com/cbm80amiga/ILI9341_Fast) repository was also a helpful source of knowledge. The device allows you to draw: 
   * pixel, 
   * line, 
   * rectangle, 
   * strings, 
   * bitmaps.
2. Communication with the **RTC DS1307** chip. The device provides the functions of reading/writing the date to the integrated circuit.
3.  Read different button states (**BUTTON_PRESSED, BUTTON_FALLING_EDGE, BUTTON_RISING_EDGE**),
4.  Sound generation with buzzer

# Games and applications

The repository contains examples showing the capabilities of the device in the **`Demo`** and **`Games`** folders. Current programs:
* **Tetris**,
* demoFillDisplayWithBitmaps();
* demoText(),
* demoLines(),
* demoDynamicText(),
* demoRTC(uint8_t setCompileTime),
* demoPlaySounds(),
